    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I was in the mood for something like a stuffed sweet potato, but changed my mind at the last minute and decided to turn this recipe into fries instead. I know. I’m wild and crazy sometimes.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 medium sweet potatoes, sliced into long fry shapes</li>
        <li>1-2 tbsp coconut oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced garlic </li>
        <li>½ red pepper diced</li>
        <li>1 ripe avocado</li>
        <li>2 limes</li>
        <li>½ c cooked black beans</li>
        <li>¼ c chives or green onions, chopped</li>
        <li>¼ c cilantro (or parsley) chopped</li>
        <li>1 jalapeno, thinly sliced (optional)</li>
        <li>¼ c basic cashew cream (use 1 whole lemon instead of ½)</li>
        <li>Sea salt and fresh pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425F and line baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Toss sweet potatoes with liquid coconut oil (you may need to warm it first) + a few good pinches of salt and pepper. </li>
        <li>Arrange in single layer on baking sheet and cook for about 30 minutes until lightly browned – tossing once, halfway through cooking.</li>
        <li>While fries cook, mash the avocado with juice of one lime and a few pinches of salt and pepper. This can be used to dip the fries into.</li>
        <li>Make cashew cream.</li>
        <li>Top with veggies, beans, a few squeezes of lime and drizzle of the cashew sour cream or use as a dip on the side.</li>
    </ol>
